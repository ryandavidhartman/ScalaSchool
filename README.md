Welcome to my little Scala School!  This started as my notes for classes I taught at Angie's List, and now has elements shamelessly stolen from the much better Scala School offered by my new employer Twitter.

In any event this repo is not endorsed by or affiliated with any company.  The mistakes are mine, and the good parts are probably stolen.
