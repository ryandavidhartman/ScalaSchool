Welcome to my little Scala School!  This started as my notes for a little Scala class I taught when I worked ANGI, and now has elements shamelessly stolen from the much better [Scala School](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/) offered by my new current employer Twitter.

In any event this repo is not endorsed by or affiliated with any company.  The mistakes are mine, and the good parts are probably stolen.
